# Particle Test Chamber
An interactive environment for testing particle behaviour in Python with PyGame. You can place and remove tiles, run simulations, and tweak many settings through a custom options menu.

## Features
- Interactive chamber. Click to add or remove tiles which lets you shape the space the particles move through.
- Particle simulation. Particles behaviour is controlled directly by the settings and their movement responds to the layout you build.
- Custom options menu. You can alter almost every part of the simulation, including particle count, gravity strength, and tile colour.
- Real time updates. Changes apply at once so you can experiment and see how each setting effects the simulation.
